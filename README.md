## About The Project
The motivation behind this project was that I wanted to know about how online judges on different coding platforms works and run the source codes in the browser. So for that reason I started researching on how can I built something like that in Node JS and then I created the REST API for the same with express and node.

So this project will enable anyone who has access to internet and any web browser to compile and run source codes of various languages like C,C++,Java,Python,Javascript (Node JS),Golang,Rust,Ruby,Elixir,etc. without any environment setup on their local machine.
